                    <p class="u-text u-text-palette-5-dark-2 u-text-1"><b>In recent years, there has been a continually astonishing amount of development in the use of wind energy all around the globe. By the end of the year 2000, there were almost 1,7500 megawatts worth of wind turbines producing power across more than 50 countries. Over 70,000 MW of these were installed in countries that are part of the European Union (EU). The year 2000 was itself a record-breaking year for the European Union, as it saw the installation of more than 3,500 MW of new units. At the same time, the sector of making wind turbines in Europe is seeing phenomenal growth. The four main producers in Europe are responsible for providing nearly two-thirds of the global market.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>The major nations for wind power in Europe are Germany, Denmark, and Spain. Together, these three countries represent more than 80 percent of the entire wind capacity in Europe, with a total installed capacity of 7675 MW in 1999. These nations have established a comprehensive national strategy for the expansion of wind power and have successfully implemented a policy of evolutionary growth by providing assistance to the wind turbine sector as well as wind power expansion via research and development endeavors. The introduction of incentive programmes in the form of feed-in tariffs measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) has significantly increased the number of wind power installations and investments in related fields. In addition, this had a good impact on the industries that manufacture wind turbines around the country. Despite having excellent wind potential, other European nations that have not adopted comparable assistance methods have been less successful.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>Since the early 1980s, the European Union has provided continuous support for the development of wind power via the funding of specific research, development, and demonstration projects. When the European Commission made the development of renewable energy sources a top priority in the early 1990s for the security and diversity of the energy supply, for environmental protection, for social and economic cohesion, and for other reasons, this support was further enhanced.&nbsp;</b>
