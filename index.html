                    <p class="u-text u-text-palette-5-dark-2 u-text-1"><b>Wind energy is one subset of the energy business that has seen significant growth in the United States over the course of the last few years. Wind energy contributed 379.8 terawatt-hours, or 9.23%, to the total amount of electrical energy produced in the United States from the beginning of 2021 to the end of the same year. The typical wind turbine can produce enough energy in forty-six minutes to supply the power needs of a typical house in the United States for a whole month. In 2019, wind power became the greatest renewable energy source produced in the United States, surpassing hydroelectric power as the top source. In the United States, the total installed wind power nameplate producing capacity was 135,843 megawatts as of January 2022. (MW). Only China and the European Union have a capacity that is higher than this one. The installation of 16,913 MW worth of wind power in 2020 was the most significant increase in capacity for wind power to date. It was followed by 2021, which saw the addition of 13,365 MW, and 2012, which saw the installation of 11,895 MW, which represented 26.5% of the additional electricity capacity that was constructed during that year. As of September 2019, 19 states have installed capacities of more than 1,000 MW, with Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and California providing more than half of all wind energy in the United States combined. At the end of 2019, Texas has the largest installed wind generating capacity of any state in the United States. With 28,843 MW of capacity, Texas provided around 16.8% of the state's total energy consumption. Additionally, Texas has a greater number of installations now under development than any other state currently has installed. With nearly 57% of its total energy output coming from wind power, Iowa is the state that generates the largest proportion of energy from wind power, yet North Dakota has the most energy generated by the wind per capita.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>The installed capacity of wind power in the European Union reached a total of 169.3 gigawatts as of the end of December 2017. In 2017, a total of 15,680 megawatts (MW) of wind power capacity was added, which accounted for 55% of all new power capacity. The wind power produced 336 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy, which was sufficient to meet 11.6% of the EU's need for electricity. It is quite probable that the use of wind power will continue to expand throughout the European Union in the years to come. Wind power has the potential to play a significant part in meeting Europe's goals for the use of renewable energy, according to research published by the European Environment Agency (EEA). According to projections made by the European Wind Energy Association, which is now known as WindEurope, 230 gigawatts (GW) of wind power will be constructed in Europe by the year 2020. Of this total, 190 GW will be placed onshore, while 40 GW will be installed offshore. This would result in 14–17% of the EU's power being produced, a reduction of 333 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, and a savings of €28 billion annually in fuel prices for the EU. Research conducted by a broad range of organizations in a number of European nations has shown that the general public in those nations has a continuous level of support for wind power that is about 80 percent. By the year 2020, the penetration of wind power had reached 56% in Denmark, 36% in Lithuania, 35% in Ireland, 23% in Portugal, 23% in Germany, 20% in Spain, 18% in Greece, 16% in Sweden, and 15% (on average) across the European Union.</b>
